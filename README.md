## Online Resume

A simple Jekyll + GitHub Pages powered resume.

Change all the details from one place: `_data/data.yml` file.
I added a sidebar section of "Continuing Education" and changed "Education" to "Academic Education"
Many other changes based on my own skill set and expericence. 
Feel Free to contact me if you have any question.

## Themes
There are 6 color schemes available: 
blue, turquoise, green, berry, orange & ceramic.
Customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages for free 

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account. 
Just make sure you're using a github-pages branch, and the site will automatically be available 
at `{yourusername}.github.io/{repository-name}`. 
You can also add a CNAME if you want it to be available at a custom domain.

## Configuring with your own domain name

To setup your GitHub Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions]
(https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)
on the GitHub Help site for that topic.
