## Online Resume

A simple Jekyll + GitHub Pages powered resume.

Change all the details from one place: `_data/data.yml` file.

## Themes
There are 6 color schemes available: 
blue, turquoise, green, berry, orange & ceramic.
Customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages for free 

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account. 
Just make sure you're using a gh-pages branch, and the site will automatically be 
available at `{yourusername}.github.io/{repository-name}`. You can also add a CNAME if you want
it to be available at a custom domain.

## Configuring with your own domain name

To setup your GitHub Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)
on the GitHub Help site for that topic.
