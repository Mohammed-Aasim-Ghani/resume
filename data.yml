    I really enjoy picking software apart and seeing where I can find flaws and I am passionate about improving
    quality and shipping high-reliability products. I have worked with a range of different programming languages
    and automation frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The things that
    I currently have the most experience working with are Java, Selenium WebDriver, Appium, JUnit, TestNG,
    Cucumber-JVM (BDD), Gherkin, Git and Jenkins.
